    "Wewill use 2D-convolution kernels and the OpenCV Computer Vision library to apply different blurring and sharpening techniques to an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### An Introduction to Convolution Kernels in Image Processing\n",
    "In image processing, a convolution kernel is a 2D matrix that is used to filter images. Also known as a convolution matrix, a convolution kernel is typically a square, MxN matrix, where both M and N are odd integers (e.g. 3×3, 5×5, 7×7 etc.). See the 3×3 example matrix given below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A 3×3 2D convolution kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Such kernels can be used to perform mathematical operations on each pixel of an image to achieve a desired effect (like blurring or sharpening an image). But why would you want to blur an image? Here are two important reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Because it reduces certain types of noise in an image. For this reason, blurring is often referred to as smoothing.\n",
    "2. To remove a distracting background, you might intentionally blur portions of an image, as is done in ‘Portrait’ mode, on mobile device cameras.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being a fundamental processing technique in Computer Vision, filtering images with kernels has many more applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How to Use Kernels to Sharpen or Blur Images\n",
    "Filtering of a source image is achieved by convolving the kernel with the image. In simple terms, convolution of an image with a kernel represents a simple mathematical operation, between the kernel and its corresponding elements in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that the center of the kernel is positioned over a specific pixel (p), in an image.\n",
    "Then multiply the value of each element in the kernel (1 in this case), with the corresponding pixel element (i.e. its pixel intensity) in the source image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, sum the result of those multiplications and compute the average.\n",
    "Finally, replace the value of pixel (p), with the average value you just computed.\n",
    "Once you perform this operation for every pixel in the source image, using the above 3×3 kernel, the resulting filtered image will appear blurred. This is because the convolution operation with this kernel has an averaging effect, which tends to smooth or blur the image. You will soon see for yourself how the value of individual elements in a kernel dictate the nature of filtering. For example, by changing the value of the kernel elements, you can also achieve a sharpening effect. The concept is simple yet very powerful, and is therefore used in numerous image processing pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Applying the Identity Kernel to an Image in OpenCV\n",
    "Before we describe how to implement blurring and sharpening kernels, let’s first learn about the identity kernel. The identity kernel is a square matrix, where the middle element is 1, and all other elements are zero, as shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "A 3×3 identity kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes an identity matrix special is that multiplying it with any other matrix will return the original matrix. Let’s now demonstrate how to use this identity kernel with OpenCV filtering functions. In this first example, we will use the above identity kernel to show that the filtering operation leaves the original image unchanged.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Start by importing OpenCV and Numpy, as shown in the code below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following steps are performed in the code below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read the test image\n",
    "2. Define the identity kernel, using a 3×3 NumPy array\n",
    "3. Use the filter2D() function in OpenCV to perform the linear filtering operation\n",
    "4. Display the original and filtered images, using imshow()\n",
    "5. Save the filtered image to disk, using imwrite()\n",
    "\n",
    "filter2D(src, ddepth, kernel)\n",
    "\n",
    "The filter2D()function requires three input arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.The first argument is the source image\n",
    "2.The second argument is ddepth, which indicates the depth of the resulting image. A value of -1 3.indicates that the final image will also have the same depth as the source image\n",
    "4.The final input argument is the kernel, which we apply to the source image\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Blurring an Image using a Custom 2D-Convolution Kernel\n",
    "Next, we will demonstrate how to blur an image. Here too, we will define a custom kernel, and use the filter2D() function in OpenCV to apply the filtering operation on the source image. \n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by defining a 5×5 kernel, consisting of only ones. Note that we also divide the kernel by 25. Why is that? Well, before you apply any convolution to an image, using a 2D-convolution matrix, you need to ensure that all the values are normalized. This is done by dividing each element of the kernel, by the number of elements in the kernel, which in this case is 25. This ensures all values stay within the range of [0,1]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now use the filter2D() function to filter the image. As you can see, filter2D() can be used to convolve an image, with any user-defined kernel.\n",

    "#### Applying Bilateral Filtering to an Image in OpenCV\n",
    "While blurring can be an effective way to reduce noise in an image, it is often not desirable to blur the entire image, as important details and sharp edges may be lost. In such cases, bilateral filtering can make your life easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique applies the filter selectively to blur similar intensity pixels in a neighborhood. Sharp edges are preserved, wherever possible.\n",
    "It lets you control not only the spatial size of the filter, but also the degree to which the neighboring pixels are included in the filtered output. This is done, based on variation in their color intensity, and also distance from the filtered pixel.\n",
    "Bilateral filtering essentially applies a 2D Gaussian (weighted) blur to the image, while also considering the variation in intensities of neighboring pixels to minimize the blurring near edges (which we wish to preserve). What this means is that the shape of the kernel actually depends on the local image content, at every pixel location.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a concrete example. Assume, you are filtering a region in an image, near an edge. A simple Gaussian blur filter would blur the edge because it lies near the filtered region (close to the center of the Gaussian filter).  But the bilateral filter can sense the edge, because it also considers differences in pixel intensities. So, it will compute a much lower weight for the pixels straddling the edge, thereby reducing their influence on the filtered region. Regions of more uniform intensity are blurred heavier, as they are not associated with strong edges.\n",
