    "##### Introduction\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will explain how to scale and resize image in Python by using the OpenCV function cv2.resize(). We shall first cover the syntax of cv2.resize() and understand its various parameters and options. Then we will see various examples of resizing the images using this function.\n",

    "Resizing Image using OpenCV : cv2.resize()\n",
    "\n",
    "###Syntax\n",
    "cv2.resize(src, dsize, fx, fy, interpolation)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. src – This is the input image that needs to be resized.\n",
    "2. dsize – The size of the output image, given as (width, height)\n",
    "3. fx – This denotes the scale factor along the x-axis\n",
    "4. fy – This denotes the scale factor along the y-axis\n",
    "\n",
    "interpolation – Denotes the interpolation techniques, default is cv2.INTER_LINEAR\n",
    "Some Points to Consider about cv2.resize()\n",
    "You may use either dsize or both fx and fy to resize the image.\n",
    "dsize parameter can be used to specify the exact image size. But for this, you will have to calculate the width and height of the resized image beforehand.\n",
    "fx and fy are good options if you want to scale the image with a factor. For e.g. 0.5 for half, 2 for double, etc.\n",
    "Interpolation Parameters for cv2.resize()\n",
    "To resize the image, the cv2 resize() function uses interpolation for resizing. This is because when the image is scaled up it needs more pixels to fill up the spaces between actual pixels. And when the image is scaled down it needs to\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. cv2.INTER_LINEAR – It uses bilinear interpolation, which is preferably used for scaling up the image to a larger size. This is the default option in cv2.resize()\n",
    "2. cv2.INTER_NEAREST – It uses nearest-neighbor interpolation, which is fast but produces blocky images.\n",
    "3. cv2.INTER_AREA – It uses pixel area interpolation which is better used for downscaling the image.\n",
    "4. cv2.INTER_CUBIC – It uses bicubic interpolation over a 4 x 4 pixel neighborhood. It is relatively slow.\n",
    "5. cv2.INTER_LANCZOS4 – It uses Lanczos interpolation over an 8 x 8 pixel neihborhood, it produces the highest quality but is slow."
