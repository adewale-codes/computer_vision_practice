    "##### Edge Detection Using OpenCV\n",
    "\n",
    "Edge detection is an image-processing technique that is used to identify the boundaries (edges) of objects or regions within an image. Edges are among the most important features associated with images. We know the underlying structure of an image through its edges. Computer vision processing pipelines, therefore, extensively use edge detection in applications.\n",

    "##### How are Edges Detected?\n",
    "Sudden changes in pixel intensity characterize edges. We need to look for such changes in the neighboring pixels to detect edges. Let’s explore using two important edge-detection algorithms available in OpenCV: Sobel Edge Detection and Canny Edge Detection. We will discuss the theory as well as demonstrate the use of each in OpenCV.\n",

    "Before going into each algorithm in detail, let’s complete some preliminary steps for edge detection. Start by importing the OpenCV library, as shown in the code below. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to read in the image, using the imread() function in OpenCV. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we read in the color image as a grayscale image because you do not need color information to detect edges. To learn more refer: Read, Display and Write an Image using OpenCV.\n",
    "\n",
    "After reading the image, we also blur it, using the GaussianBlur() function. This is done to reduce the noise in the image. In edge detection, numerical derivatives of the pixel intensities have to be computed, and this typically results in ‘noisy’ edges. In other words, the intensity of neighboring pixels in an image (especially near edges) can fluctuate quite a bit, giving rise to edges that don’t represent the predominant edge structure we are looking for. \n",
    "\n",
    "Blurring smoothens the intensity variation near the edges, making it easier to identify the predominant edge structure within the image. You can refer to the OpenCV documentation for more details on the GaussianBlur() function. We supply the size of the convolution kernel (in this case, 1 3×3 kernel), which specifies the degree of blurring.\n",

    "Canny Edge Detection is one of the most popular edge-detection methods in use today because it is so robust and flexible. The algorithm itself follows a three-stage process for extracting edges from an image. Add to it image blurring, a necessary preprocessing step to reduce noise. This makes it a four-stage process, which includes:\n",

    "2. Calculating the Intensity Gradient of the Image\n",
    "3. Suppression of False Edges\n",
    "4. Hysteresis Thresholding\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Noise Reduction\n",
    "Raw image pixels can often lead to noisy edges, so it is essential to reduce noise before computing edges In Canny Edge Detection, a Gaussian blur filter is used to essentially remove or minimize unnecessary detail that could lead to undesirable edges. Have a look at the tiger in the two images below; Gaussian blur has been applied to the image to the right. As you can see, it appears slightly blurred but still retains a significant amount of detail from which edges can be computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Suppression of False Edges\n",
    "After reducing noise and calculating the intensity gradient, the algorithm in this step uses a technique called non-maximum suppression of edges to filter out unwanted pixels (which may not actually constitute an edge). To accomplish this, each pixel is compared to its neighboring pixels in the positive and negative gradient direction. If the gradient magnitude of the current pixel is greater than its neighboring pixels, it is left unchanged. Otherwise, the magnitude of the current pixel is set to zero. The following image illustrates an example.  As you can see, numerous ‘edges’ associated with the tiger’s fur have been significantly subdued.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Hysteresis Thresholding – Edge Detection Using OpenCV\n",
    "In this final step of Canny Edge Detection, the gradient magnitudes are compared with two threshold values, one smaller than the other. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the gradient magnitude value is higher than the larger threshold value, those pixels are associated with solid edges and are included in the final edge map.\n",
    "If the gradient magnitude values are lower than the smaller threshold value, the pixels are suppressed and excluded from the final edge map.\n",
    "All the other pixels, whose gradient magnitudes fall between these two thresholds, are marked as ‘weak’ edges (i.e. they become candidates for being included in the final edge map). \n",
    "If the ‘weak’ pixels are connected to those associated with solid edges, they are also included in the final edge map. \n",
    "The following is the syntax for applying Canny edge detection using OpenCV:\n",
    "\n",
    "Canny(image, threshold1, threshold2)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code example below, the  Canny() function implements the methodology described above. We supply the two thresholds used by the Canny Edge Detection algorithm, and OpenCV handles all the implementation details. Don’t forget to blur the image before calling the Canny() function. It is a highly-recommended preprocessing step.\n"
